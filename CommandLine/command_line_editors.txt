This is just a basic guide for Emacs and Vi command line editors. If you do not know either vi or emacs I would recommend learning emacs because it is more intuitive. 

## emacs ## 
From the command line you can edit a file using:
emacs file.txt 

You can navigate with the arrows and insert text. To save use the commands Ctrl-x Ctrl-s. After use Ctrl-x Ctrl-c to exit. 

Other basic commands:
Ctrl-a : go to start of line
Ctrl-e : go to end of line
Ctrl-k : kill/cut the rest of the line
Ctrl-w : kill/cut the current selection
Ctrl-y : Yank/paste any killed/cut stuff

Many more commands exist, here's one resource:

Also I recommend a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to emacs, such as:
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/


## vi ##
Vi is a precursor to emacs, can be faster but requires more commands.
vi file.txt

Type `i` to get to -- Insert -- mode and edit the text. Press `esc` to get to the vi command line, type :w to save, :q to quit, :q! to quit without saving

And a gui's do exist but vi is strongest on the command line (most cases emacs is better, you can try to convince me otherwise but I doubt you can http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war):
