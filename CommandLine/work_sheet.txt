FILE SYSTEM NAVIGATION
======================

* What command you type in to move into a directory called "Documents"? Then move back?

* What command would you type to move to your home directory?

* What are three ways to get help for a command?

* What does "ls -haltr" do? How would you make an alias for it?

FILE MANIPULATION
=================

Run:  echo -e "System PATH as of `date` \n $PATH" > find_command_path.txt

* What are two ways to view the contents of "find_command_path.txt"?

* How do you create a directory? Create a directory called "PathData".

* Copy "find_command_path.txt" to "PathData" and rename it "path.txt"

* How would you rename "PathData" to "MySystemPathData"?

* How would you search for all files that end in *.txt? Did you find "path.txt"?

* How would you delete "MySystemPathData" and all it's contents?


ETC

* How do you create an alias for a command?

Download a zipped file from git (or git clone) using:

wget https://github.com/AstroJuniorResearcherMeetings/RSG_2014/archive/master.zip



FILE MANIPULATION
=================

* Decompress (unzip) the file from the git hub. 

* How would you create a file which contains all ".txt" files that begin with "data" in the current directory? (hint: ls and |)

* How would you create the same file but with all files of the form "data_00.fits"?


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

* What is PATH? Use echo to display and copy it here.

* How would you add a path to environment variable PATH?

* What kind of shell are you working in? (Bash or Tcsh?)

* Copy the appropriate startup script to your home directory. 
Open a new shell (i.e. source the file). Try to run `matrix`. 

* From the git hub download find a file called whereami. Look at it. Add that directory to your PATH.

REMOTE SERVERS/FILE SYSTEMS
===========================

For the following if you have a user account at CHPC or PHYSICS try doing them.
one CHPC server:
astro03.astro.utah.edu

one Physics server:
physics.utah.edu

* What command would you use to login to a server (hostname) called "physics.utah.edu"? 

* What command would you use to copy a file (like "find_command_path.txt") to "physics.utah.edu" if your username is "dave"?

* What command would you use to copy a directory (like "PathData") from "physics.utah.edu" if your username is "dave"?

* How would you turn a directory "PathData" into a tarball (using pathdata.tar)?

* How would you also compress the tarball? (think gzip/zip)


* Create a script which moves you to the home directory and execute.

* Add the script to your $PATH so you can type it anywhere.


-- Create a file called "two_second_tom.sh" with:
#!/bin/csh
while true
do 
    echo "Hi, my name is Tom"
    sleep 2
done

* Run `screen` and execute the script "two_second_tom.sh". Then exit out of the screen. 
Resume the screen to see that the command is still running. Kill the command with ctrl-k and exit the screen.


REMOTE SERVERS/FILE SYSTEMS
===========================


* How would you sync the directory "PathData" to your username at "physics.utah.edu" (if set up)? 

* How would you exclude a directory called "LargeData" from syncing?
